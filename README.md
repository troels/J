J
=

An incomplete but entertaining attempt at reimplementing the [J programming](http://www.jsoftware.com/)
language in modern C++. 

The J programming language is an interesting language designed primarily by Ken Iverson for making a successor
to APL fixing some of its perceived flaws. The extreme brevity and fundamental array primitives
makes it a language very well adapted to doing quick one-off statistical or other mathematical processing.

Some examples of J can be found in the file "test.cpp".
